# Deployed

https://brave-moss-071f7c610.1.azurestaticapps.net/home  
(We are using free server hosting plan, so the backend server will go into IDLE if having no access for 15mins. Please wait patiently for its restart. You might need to wait up to 5 mins. Frontend will display basic structure but won't be able to fetch posts or perform other actions during this time)
